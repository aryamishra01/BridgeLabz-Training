## Week 3: Data Structures Fundamentals  

### 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Data Structures & Linked Lists  
**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

- Learned the fundamentals of **Data Structures** and their importance in efficient problem-solving  
- Understood key features of **Data Structures in Java** such as efficiency, scalability, and abstraction  
- Explored different **types of Data Structures** including Linear and Non-Linear structures  
- Studied **Singly Linked List** concepts, node structure, and one-directional traversal  
- Implemented **Doubly Linked List** with forward and backward traversal using previous and next references  
- Learned **Circular Linked List** where the last node points back to the first node for continuous traversal  
- Analyzed real-world use cases of linked lists such as memory management, scheduling, and navigation systems

### 📅 Day 2 – Stack, Queue & HashMap  
**(Date: 03-Jan-2026)**

- Learned the concept of **Stack** (LIFO – Last In First Out) and its core operations: push, pop, peek  
- Implemented Stack using **arrays and Java Collections**

- Learned the concept of **Queue** (FIFO – First In First Out) and operations: enqueue, dequeue, front  
- Implemented Queue using **arrays and LinkedList**  
- Studied applications of Queue in scheduling, buffering, and task management  
- Explored **HashMap** and the concept of **Hashing**  
- Understood **Hashing Function**, key-value pairs, collision handling, and performance benefits  
- Analyzed average time complexity of HashMap operations as **O(1)**
