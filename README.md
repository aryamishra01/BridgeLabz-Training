## Week 3: Data Structures Fundamentals  

### 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Data Structures & Linked Lists  
**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

- Learned the fundamentals of **Data Structures** and their importance in efficient problem-solving  
- Understood key features of **Data Structures in Java** such as efficiency, scalability, and abstraction  
- Explored different **types of Data Structures** including Linear and Non-Linear structures  
- Studied **Singly Linked List** concepts, node structure, and one-directional traversal  
- Implemented **Doubly Linked List** with forward and backward traversal using previous and next references  
- Learned **Circular Linked List** where the last node points back to the first node for continuous traversal  
- Analyzed real-world use cases of linked lists such as memory management, scheduling, and navigation systems
