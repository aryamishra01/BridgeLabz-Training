### 📅 Day 5 – Inheritance  
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)**

- Practiced core **inheritance concepts** to reuse and extend common behavior in Java  
- Implemented **Single, Multilevel, and Hierarchical inheritance** using classes  
- Understood why **multiple inheritance is not supported with classes** due to the *diamond problem*  
- Implemented **hybrid inheritance using interfaces**, combining `extends` and `implements`  
- Explored **method overriding** and **runtime polymorphism**  
- Solved real-world, scenario-based problems such as:
  - Animal Classification System  
  - Employee Hierarchy  
  - Vehicle Management  
  - Banking Operations  
  - School Role Structure  
- Followed best practices like the is-a relationship,LSP, and avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies
