## Week 4: Java Collections Framework  

### 📅 Day 1 – Generics  
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

- Practiced Java Generics for type safety and code reusability.  
- Implemented multiple real-world scenarios using generic classes and methods.  
- Used bounded type parameters and wildcards for flexible designs.  
- Ensured compile-time type safety across all implementations.

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework (JCF)  
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

- Studied the purpose, structure, and hierarchy of the **Java Collections Framework**.  
- Worked with core interfaces: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and `Map` along with their implementations.  
- Compared collections based on performance, ordering, duplication, and thread-safety.  
- Applied best practices to choose suitable collections for different problem scenarios.

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Streams  
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**

- Implemented Java **I/O Streams** to handle file-based and in-memory data operations efficiently.  
- Worked with:
  - File Streams  
  - Object Streams  
  - ByteArray Streams  
  - Buffered Streams  
  - Reader/Writer classes  
- Understood the differences between **byte streams** and **character streams** for proper data handling.  
- Applied key considerations and best practices for:
  - Performance  
  - Buffering  
  - Resource management
