## Week 2: Object Oriented Programming Fundamental 

### 📅 Day 1 – Java OOPS Basics
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its advantages over Procedural Programming
- Understood Class and Object concepts, object creation, and memory allocation
- Practiced using constructors, attributes, and methods with real-world examples (Student, Car, TravelDetails)
- Compared Procedural Programming vs OOP in terms of scalability, reusability, and data security
- Followed best practices for naming conventions and modular program structure

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables & Access Modifiers  
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

- Learned how **constructors** initialize objects in Java  
- Practiced **parameterized constructors** using real-world examples  
- Understood the difference between **instance variables** and **class (static) variables**  
- Used **static methods** to handle shared data  
- Learned and applied **access modifiers** (`public`, `protected`, `private`)  
- Implemented **encapsulation** using getters and setters  
- Practiced **inheritance** to demonstrate access control  
- Built mini programs such as:
  - Product Inventory System  
  - Course Management System  
  - Bank Account Management  
  - Employee Records  
  - Book Library System

### 📅 Day 3 – Java Keywords: this, static, final & instanceof  
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the use of **`this` keyword** to refer to current object  
- Practiced **`static` keyword** for class-level variables and methods  
- Understood **`final` keyword** for constants and preventing inheritance/overriding  
- Explored **`instanceof` operator** to check object types at runtime  
- Applied these keywords in **real-world mini programs**:  
  - BankAccount  
  - Book  
  - Company  
  - Library  
  - Patient  
  - Product  
  - Student  
  - Vehicle
