## Week 4: Java Collections Framework  

### 📅 Day 1 – Generics  
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

- Practiced Java Generics for type safety and code reusability.  
- Implemented multiple real-world scenarios using generic classes and methods.  
- Used bounded type parameters and wildcards for flexible designs.  
- Ensured compile-time type safety across all implementations.

### 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework (JCF)  
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

- Studied the purpose, structure, and hierarchy of the **Java Collections Framework**.  
- Worked with core interfaces: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`, and `Map` along with their implementations.  
- Compared collections based on performance, ordering, duplication, and thread-safety.  
- Applied best practices to choose suitable collections for different problem scenarios.
